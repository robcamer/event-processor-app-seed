# EventProcessor App Seed

This is an application seed that is part of the general Network Observability solution consisting of containerized .NET application development with cloud-native capabilities.

Follow this link for a more generic version of a [.NET Project App Seed](https://github.com/microsoft/coral-seed-dotnet-core-webapi)

Backlog in Coral project: [#170 Create new coral-seed-dotnet-core-webapi on .NET Core 6.0](https://github.com/microsoft/coral/issues/170)

## Getting Started

To get started with Coral, see the [platform setup instructions](https://github.com/microsoft/coral/blob/main/docs/platform-setup.md) in the main [Coral](https://github.com/microsoft/coral) repo.

### For Github follow below
To use this seed, the network-observability-utilities template repository needs to be configured as well. 
This seed depends on nuget packages that will be deployed by the network-observability-utilities repo.

Required packages:
- EFR.NetworkObservability.Common
- EFR.NetworkObservability.DataModel
- EFR.NetworkObservability.RabbitMQ

[Note:] The package utilities instance should exist in the same org, since the pipline uses the token which has access to the same org

Once the network-observability-utilities repo is setup and the packages are deployed, you will need to give the repo access to those packages so the Github action can successfully build and deploy the image. You can do that by following the steps below:

![Package Steps](./docs/packages.png)

## Baseline Features

The application seed contains the following cloud-native capabilities:

1. Performance metrics
2. Data storage
3. Metadata for observability

## Network Observability Features

EventProcessor will process an event metadata json and store it in the Database for Observability dashboards

Input:

an event json, sample can be found in [eventsample.json](eventsample.json)

Output:

```bash
SELECT * FROM EventMetaData
```

![Saved event](docs/db.png)

## Application Development

The project contains a [sample .env](./.env.example) file that must be configured and made into a .env file before dotnet commands can be issued.
Once the file has been configured, there are three ways it can be loaded.

- The most simple way is just by opening a new bash terminal. The .env file will be injected into the environment automatically.
- The following command can be issued to load the .env `source .env`
- If the above two doesn't work, the following command can be issued if the .env file has comments ``export `cat .env | awk '!/^[[:blank:]]*$/' | grep -o '^[^#]*'` && bash``. If comments are removed from the .env file then this command will work ``export `cat .env` && bash``

After the .env is loaded the following commands will work.

- In src/App, run `dotnet build` to build your app
- In src/App, run `dotnet run` to run your app
- In test/App.Test, run `dotnet test` to run unit tests

## Environment Configuration

The following variables are required to allow  successful pipeline and local builds. Select a platform to view.

### Workflow Piplines For GitHub

Docker file is created under root /Dockerfile which does a build and push to the configured registry container.
For a sucessfull pipeline run, Once the dotnet repo is created add the below CI-CD pipeline variables for the Repository

```bash
CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URL : conatiner-registry-url
CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN : conatiner-registry-accesstoken
CONTAINER_REGISTRY_USER : conatiner-registry-user
NUGET_PLATFORM_URL: Nuget-platform-github-url
NUGET_SOURCE_URL: Nuget-common-package-source-url
```

### Workflow Pipelines For GitLab

- Create the necessary Common library packages using repo <https://code.afcmade.com/devteam/cse/cse-efr-coral/templates/NetworkObservabilityUtilities>
- Create a GitLab Pipline Runner for the group if not already available. Document to create a runner with the runner tag can be found at network-observability-control-plane-seed/docs/design-decisions/gitlab-runner.md
- Clone the App seed repo into GitLab
- Create the below CICD variables

```bash
CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URL : conatiner-registry-url
CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN : conatiner-registry-accesstoken
CONTAINER_REGISTRY_USER : conatiner-registry-user
```

- Update the nuget.config files with the gitlab specific common library path , similar to below

```bash
<add key="gitlab" value="https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/---/index.json" />
<gitlab>
  <add key="Username" value="%GITLAB_PACKAGE_REGISTRY_USERNAME%" />
  <add key="ClearTextPassword" value="%GITLAB_PACKAGE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD%" />
</gitlab>
```

- Update the docker file to use these ARG variables

``` bash
ARG GITLAB_PACKAGE_REGISTRY_USERNAME
ARG GITLAB_PACKAGE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD
```

### Container Development

Your Codespace has a preconfigured running cluster so that you can validate how your application will behave when deployed

- From `Tasks: Run Task` (press `Ctrl+Shift+P`), select `Run in local cluster`. Your app will load in a new browser tab.
- To reset the local cluster for any reason, you can use the `Reset local cluster` task

Your Codespace also has a local portal that exposes a number of services that will also be present when your app is deployed

- Using `Tasks: Run Task`, select `Launch Platform Portal in New Tab`
- The application increments a metric named `hits` each time the "Hello, World!" path is used. From the portal, use [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) to query app metrics
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) is also available for visualization. The instance is local to your Codespace with the following settings:
  - A `Sample Dashboard` to see the `api_hits_total` counter (Navigate to the 'General' folder to see the link)
- [Fluentbit](https://fluentbit.io/) is configured to scrape the application and Kubernetes logs and can be accessed from the portal. A Fluentbit filter is applied to the application logs to exclude log messages that contain 200 responses at the `/healthcheck` and `/metrics` endpoints. [Serilog](https://serilog.net/) can be configured to your needs. For more information on how to configure the logger, see the [Serilog wiki](https://github.com/serilog/serilog/wiki/Configuration-Basics).

> You can also view the list of [forwarded ports](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/forwarding-ports-in-your-codespace) available to your Codespace in the `PORTS` tab in the Integrated Terminal

### Configuring a different Container Registry

This environment comes with github actions to build and push the application containers to the GitHub container registry.

If you wish, you can configure the repo to use the container registry of your choice by [creating the following secrets in the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository):

- CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URL
- CONTAINER_REGISTRY_USER
- CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN

These values can be obtained from your specific container registry provider.

> **Note**
>
> To return to the default, simply remove the secrets from the repository.
